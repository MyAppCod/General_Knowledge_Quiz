# General_Knowledge_Quiz
 
This website code can be used to any quiz related websites. 

This was built based on the help of many reference codes in the internet.

Also this contains my own ideas in CSS styling and in the result screen.

This website so far contains 25 general knowledge quiz. If the question is not answered and moving to the next, then the alert pops up. 

At the end of the quiz, the scores are displayed. If all the questions are answered right, you will see the message below the score as "Well done !! Keep it up !!". If most of the the questions are answered right, you will see the message below the score as "Try again...". If your score are aalmost near to the full score, you will see the message below the score as "You are almost there !! Keep Trying...".
